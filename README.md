To replicate our code, please make sure you include all of the files, packages, and datasets we uploaded above. 

Please note that at the moment, we have two notebooks. One notebook has our estimated demands code. Another notebook has our nutritional adequacy and policy changes code. You can run these notebooks separately since we uploaded the files/data from the estimated demands portion that are required for the nutritional adequacy/policy changes notebook. This data is imported/read into in the nutritional adequacy/policy changes notebook.
